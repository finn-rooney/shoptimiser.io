                <br /><br />Our Store Accelerator Method increases store
                conversions dramatically without advertising.
                <br /><br />Why is this important?
                <br /><br />If you run a CBD business, you understand the
                pitfalls of advertising as a strategy to increase salesâ€¦
                <br /><br />Endless suspensions & loss of advertising ability
                resulting in unpredictability in your business.
                <br /><br />Are we saying not to advertise? Of course not, but
                should you be focused on it right now? Maybe notâ€¦ hear us out
                <br /><br />Advertising may get easier for your niche, in fact
                you may have been sold on this very ideaâ€¦ but what if you could
                take instant proactive action to produce not only more
                conversions but predictabilityâ€¦
                <br /><br />Predictability that will pay dividends as
                advertising in the niche becomes more relaxed.
                <br /><br />Weâ€™ve identified a crucial conversion bottleneck
                that can be instantly fixed potentially leading to 2x the
                conversions on your store.
                <br /><br />Now, this may sound intriguing, possibly untrue. But
                you know whatâ€™s true?
                <br /><br />53% of mobile users leave if a website takes longer
                than 3s on the initial load.
                <br /><br />Coupled together that 85% of E-commerce shoppers are
                on mobile, at the very least 45% of your customers are opting
                out before your store loads.
                <br /><br />We just recently fixed this for a CBD based
                e-commerce brand leading to a 800k-1M transformation from 1
                month to the next without any outside changes or scaling.
                <br /><br />Once the niche is legitimised further in the
                advertising space, your business will be well equipped with a
                higher conversion rate on the backend.
                <br /><br />But how do you know my store is slow??
                <br /><br />If you want to check your site score: you can check
                here. If you score below 50 youâ€™re in a prime position to
                capitalise by implementing this store accelerator system.
                <br /><br />This is not your fault. Most â€˜developersâ€™ are middle
                men that buy expensive shopify templates on your behalf and
                charge fat premiums to afford swanky offices.
                <br /><br />Also shopify store development at its heart is built
                on top of a drag and drop system similar to Wordpress, wix,
                squarepass etc.
                <br /><br />The benefit? Shopify gives access to the low level
                backend code of your site allowing it to be optimised by
                competent developers.
                <br /><br />In general, any successful shopify store will have
                many apps installed, some sort of complicated â€˜one size fits
                allâ€™ theme, leading to blocks upon blocks of dead, unused code
                slowing your site dramatically.
